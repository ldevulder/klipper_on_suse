# Klipper on SUSE Linux

**!! This are still Work-In-Progress scripts !!**

Scripts and configuration files to natively install a Klipper environment on SUSE Linux.

For now it only supports SUSE Leap 16.0, Tumbleweed and Slowroll.

Tested on x86_64 and aarch64 architectures but should work on others as well.

The only drawback is that to be able to compile the firmware part of Klipper a cross-compiler might be needed, but you can also directly compile on the targeted architecture.

Tested on:
  - x86_64/aarch64 + Artillery Sidewinder X1 (slightly modified)
  - aarch64 + Creative Ender3 (highly modified)
